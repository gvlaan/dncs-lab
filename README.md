# DNCS-LAB | Assignment


University of Trento - Information and Communication Engineering

_Description_: This repository contains the Vagrant files and the scripts required to run the virtual lab environment used in the DNCS course.

_Assignment_: Based the V​agrantfile ​and the provisioning scripts available at: https://github.com/dustnic/dncs-lab​ the candidate is required to design a functioning network where any host configured and attached to​ r​outer-1​ (through ​switch​) can browse a website hosted on host-2-c.
The subnetting needs to be designed to accommodate the following requirement (no need to create more hosts than the one described in the vagrantfile):
- Up to 130 hosts in the same subnet of ​host-1-a
- Up to 25 hosts in the same subnet of h​ost-1-b
- Consume as few IP addresses as possible


## Requirements

-   10GB disk storage
-   2GB free RAM
-   Virtualbox (<https://www.virtualbox.org>)
-   Vagrant (<https://www.vagrantup.com>)
-   Internet

### Subnets

The network is divided in 4 different subnets:

-   **A** including `host-1-a` and `router-1`. The subnet is a /24 so you can get IP addresses for 254 different hosts (130 minimum required)

-   **B** including `host-1-b` and `router-1`. The subnet is a /27 so you can get IP addresses for 30 different hosts (25 minimum required)

-   **C** including `router-1` and `router-2`. The subnet is a /30 so you can get IP addresses for 2 different hosts

-   **D** including `router-2` and `host-2-c`. The subnet is a /30 so you can get IP addresses for 2 different hosts

### VLANs

Two different VLANs allow `router-1` to connect two different subnets via unique port. This two VLANs are marked with VIDs:

| VID | Subnet |
| --- | ------ |
| 10  | A      |
| 20  | B      |

### Interface-IP mapping

| Device   | Interface | IP                 | Subnet |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------ | ------ |
| host-1-a | eth1      | 192.168.10.1/24    | A      |
| router-1 | eth1.10   | 192.168.10.254/24  | A      |
| host-1-b | eth1      | 192.168.20.1/27    | B      |
| router-1 | eth1.20   | 192.168.20.30/27   | B      |
| host-2-c | eth1      | 192.168.30.1/30    | C      |
| router-2 | eth1      | 192.168.30.2/30    | C      |
| router-1 | eth2      | 192.168.255.253/30 | D      |
| router-2 | eth2      | 192.168.255.254/30 | D      |


### Vagrant file and provisioning scripts

The project folder contains the Vagrant file, used to set up all the Virtual Machines (based on Trusty64), and the provisioning scripts for each VM.

#### Router 1

Router 1 is a VM based on Trusty64. Here the code used in the Vagrantfile to create the VM with two different interfaces.
  ```ruby
    config.vm.define "router-1" do |router1|
      router1.vm.box = "minimal/trusty64"
      router1.vm.hostname = "router-1"
      router1.vm.network "private_network", virtualbox__intnet: "broadcast_router-south-1", auto_config: false
      router1.vm.network "private_network", virtualbox__intnet: "broadcast_router-inter", auto_config: false
      router1.vm.provision "shell", path: "router-1.sh"
    end
  ```
This code will execute the provisioning script named "router-1.sh"

The following lines are used to configure a trunk port for the VLAN:
  ```bash
    ip link add link eth1 name eth1.10 type vlan id 10
    ip link add link eth1 name eth1.20 type vlan id 20
  ```
Then is possible to assign IP addresses:
  ```bash
    ip addr add 192.168.10.254/24 dev eth1.10
    ip addr add 192.168.20.30/27 dev eth1.20
    ip addr add 192.168.255.253/30 dev eth2
  ```
Lastly the IP forwarding using OSPF
  ```bash
    sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
    sed -i 's/zebra=no/zebra=yes/g' /etc/frr/daemons
    sed -i 's/ospfd=no/ospfd=yes/g' /etc/frr/daemons
    service frr restart
    vtysh -c 'configure terminal' -c 'interface eth2' -c 'ip ospf area 0.0.0.0'
    vtysh -c 'configure terminal' -c 'router ospf' -c 'redistribute connected'
  ```

#### Router 2

Router 2 is a VM based on Trusty64. Here the code used in the Vagrantfile to create the VM with two different interfaces.
  ```ruby
    config.vm.define "router-2" do |router2|
      router2.vm.box = "minimal/trusty64"
      router2.vm.hostname = "router-2"
      router2.vm.network "private_network", virtualbox__intnet: "broadcast_router-south-2", auto_config: false
      router2.vm.network "private_network", virtualbox__intnet: "broadcast_router-inter", auto_config: false
      router2.vm.provision "shell", path: "router-2.sh"
    end
  ```
This code will execute the provisioning script named "router-2.sh"

The following lines are used to configure IP addresses:
  ```bash
    ip addr add 192.168.30.2/30 dev eth1
    ip addr add 192.168.255.254/30 dev eth2
  ```
Then the IP forwarding using OSPF
  ```bash
  sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
  sed -i 's/zebra=no/zebra=yes/g' /etc/frr/daemons
  sed -i 's/ospfd=no/ospfd=yes/g' /etc/frr/daemons
  service frr restart
  vtysh -c 'configure terminal' -c 'interface eth2' -c 'ip ospf area 0.0.0.0'
  vtysh -c 'configure terminal' -c 'router ospf' -c 'redistribute connected'
  ```

#### Switch

Switch is a VM based on Trusty64. Here the code used in the Vagrantfile to create the VM with three different interfaces.
  ```ruby
    config.vm.define "switch" do |switch|
      switch.vm.box = "minimal/trusty64"
      switch.vm.hostname = "switch"
      switch.vm.network "private_network", virtualbox__intnet: "broadcast_router-south-1", auto_config: false
      switch.vm.network "private_network", virtualbox__intnet: "broadcast_host_a", auto_config: false
      switch.vm.network "private_network", virtualbox__intnet: "broadcast_host_b", auto_config: false
      switch.vm.provision "shell", path: "switch.sh"
  end
  ```
This code will execute the provisioning script named "switch.sh"

The following lines are used to set up a bridge (named switch) and add the interfaces to it (_eth1_ and _eth2_ are used for VLAN):
  ```bash
    ovs-vsctl add-br switch
    ovs-vsctl add-port switch eth1
    ovs-vsctl add-port switch eth2 tag=10
    ovs-vsctl add-port switch eth3 tag=20
  ```
Then the last command to set up ovs-system:
  ```bash
    ip link set dev ovs-system up
  ```

#### Host A

Host A is a VM based on Trusty64. Here the code used in the Vagrantfile to create the VM with one interface, connected to the _switch_.
  ```ruby
    config.vm.define "host-1-a" do |hosta|
      hosta.vm.box = "minimal/trusty64"
      hosta.vm.hostname = "host-1-a"
      hosta.vm.network "private_network", virtualbox__intnet: "broadcast_host_a", auto_config: false
      hosta.vm.provision "shell", path: "host-1-a.sh"
    end
  ```
This code will execute the provisioning script named "host-1-a.sh"

The following line is used to configure the IP address on _eth1_:
  ```bash
    ip addr add 192.168.10.1/24 dev eth1
  ```
Then is possible to set a static route to _router-1_:
  ```bash
    ip route add 192.168.0.0/8 via 192.168.10.254
  ```


#### Host B

Host B is a VM based on Trusty64. Here the code used in the Vagrantfile to create the VM with one interface, connected to the _switch_.
  ```ruby
    config.vm.define "host-1-b" do |hostb|
      hostb.vm.box = "minimal/trusty64"
      hostb.vm.hostname = "host-1-b"
      hostb.vm.network "private_network", virtualbox__intnet: "broadcast_host_b", auto_config: false
      hostb.vm.provision "shell", path: "host-1-b.sh"
    end
  ```
This code will execute the provisioning script named "host-1-b.sh"

The following line is used to configure the IP address on _eth1_:
  ```bash
    ip addr add 192.168.20.1/27 dev eth1
  ```
Then is possible to set a static route to _router-1_:
  ```bash
    ip route add 192.168.0.0/8 via 192.168.20.30
  ```

#### Host C

Host C is a VM based on Trusty64. Here the code used in the Vagrantfile to create the VM with one interface, connected to the _router-2_.
  ```ruby
    config.vm.define "host-2-c" do |hostc|
      hostc.vm.box = "minimal/trusty64"
      hostc.vm.hostname = "host-2-c"
      hostc.vm.network "private_network", virtualbox__intnet: "broadcast_router-south-2", auto_config: false
      hostc.vm.provision "shell", path: "host-2-c.sh"
    end
  ```
This code will execute the provisioning script named "host-2-c.sh"

The following line is used to configure the IP address on _eth1_:
  ```bash
    ip addr add 192.168.30.1/30 dev eth1
  ```
Then is possible to set a static route to _router-2_:
  ```bash
    ip route add 192.168.0.0/8 via 192.168.30.2
  ```
Lastly the configuration of Docker to create a webserver based on Nginx and a webpage located in _/docker-nginx/html_ directory.
  ```bash
    docker pull nginx
    mkdir -p ~/docker-nginx/html
    echo "<html>
    <head><title>DNCS ASSIGNMENT</title></head>
    <body>
    <p>So long, and thanks for all the fish.<p>
    </body>
    </html>" > ~/docker-nginx/html/index.html
    docker run --name docker-nginx -p 80:80 -d -v ~/docker-nginx/html:/usr/share/nginx/html nginx
  ```


## First start

-   Install Virtualbox and Vagrant
-   Open the terminal and execute the command: `git clone https://github.com/gvlaan/dncs-lab`
-   You should be able to launch the lab from within the cloned repo folder.
  ```
    cd dncs-lab
    [~/dncs-lab] vagrant up --provision
  ```

Once you launch the vagrant script, it may take a while for the entire topology to become available.

-   Verify the status of the 6 VMs
  ```
    [dncs-lab]$ vagrant status  
    Current machine states:
    router-1                  running (virtualbox)
    router-2                  running (virtualbox)
    switch                    running (virtualbox)
    host-1-a                  running (virtualbox)
    host-1-b                  running (virtualbox)
    host-2-c                  running (virtualbox)
  ```
-   Once all the VMs are running verify you can log into all of them:
  ```
    vagrant ssh router-1
    vagrant ssh router-2
    vagrant ssh switch
    vagrant ssh host-1-a
    vagrant ssh host-1-b
    vagrant ssh host-2-c
  ```
  To log out use the command `exit`

-   to test reachability log into `host-2-c` and try to ping `host-1-b` with `ping 192.168.20.1`

  ```bash
    [dncs-lab]$ vagrant ssh host-2-c
    vagrant@host-2-c: ping 192.168.20.1
  ```
and vice versa:
  ```bash
    [dncs-lab]$ vagrant ssh host-1-b
    vagrant@host-1-b: ping 192.168.30.1
  ```
-   Get the webpage from `host-2-c` with `curl 192.168.30.1`
  ```bash
    vagrant@host-1-b: curl 192.168.30.1
  ```
